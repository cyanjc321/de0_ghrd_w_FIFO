This component is an Avalon-MM based FIFO with hardware flow control compatible
with the DMA-330 core in the hard processor system (HPS).  This component has a 
data port for writing data into the FIFO and reading data out of the FIFO.  The
CSR port is for setting the read and write watermarks as well as reading various
status bits.

The write watermark represents the amount of space (in words) that the component
needs to wait for being available in the FIFO before it performs a burst request
to the DMA.  This watermark must match the burst size programmed into the DMA
memory-to-device channel code.

The read watermark represents the amount of space (in words) that the component
needs to buffer in the FIFO before it performs a burst request to the DMA.
This watermark must match the burst size programmed into the DMA
device-to-memory channel code.

The data width configured for this component must match the burst size programmed
into the DMA channel code.  Failure to do so will cause a FIFO over/under flow.

The Synopsys protocol is used for the hardware flow control which is somewhat
different than the protocol used by the DMA-330 core (ARM protocol).  The protocol
is as follows:

1)  Single transfer line is asserted any time the TX FIFO channel is not full or
    the RX FIFO channel is not empty.
    
2)  Burst transfer line is asserted when the programmed watermark has not been
    crossed.  
    
3)  The single and burst transfer lines must remain asserted until the DMA issues
    the acknowledge back to the peripheral.  Even if the programmed watermark is
    crossed or the FIFO becomes full/empty, the peripheral must continue issuing
    the burst and single requests until acknowledged by the DMA.
    
4)  When a transfer is acknowledged the peripheral *must* deassert the burst and
    single request lines for at least one clock cycle.  


The following diagram shows the FIFO fill level and watermarks and describes when
each of the request lines will be asserted:

    - RX single is high because the FIFO is not empty
    - RX burst is high because the fill level is equal to or greater than the read watermark
    - TX single is high because the FIFO is not full
    - TX burst is high because the fill level is equal to or less than the write watermark

  issue a burst or single transfer which allows the logic in the HPS performing the adapatation of this 
  Synopsys handshake protocol over to the ARM protocol enough time to distinguish where one transfer completes
